# Image Captioning and Classification Project

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for image captioning and classification in both Nepali and English languages. The system will take an input image and generate descriptive captions in both languages, while also classifying the image into relevant categories. The project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models and techniques to achieve accurate and meaningful results.
